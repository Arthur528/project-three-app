## Description
Projects have played a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you apply for development jobs, your portfolio is absolutely vital to opening doors to opportunities. Your portfolio showcases high-quality deployed examples of your work, and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.

This project is a fantastic opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. Remember that employers want to know what you can do, but they also want to know how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job. 

## Notes
This is very basic I know it that it does't fall under the requirements of project 3, per Joe's comment "A react project that allows for CRUD of some sort of item (albeit without a database attached) will be enough to satisfy project 3 requirements." qouted from Joe Rehfuss on Slack to me. I put some backend in it even though Joe waived the backend requirement.
